### Composition
- React elements like `<Contacts />` and `<Chat />` are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.

### React.js

The only way you should change state is via the setState method.

- React Context :

allows you to create global context objects that can be given to any component you make.This allows you to share data without having to pass props down all the way through the DOM tree
