## Linked List
-  linear, dynamic data structures, sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
-  each Node references the next Node.

## arrays vs. linked lists:
- arrays need a continuous block of memory
- linked lists dont need to be continuous in memory

## Parts of a linked list:
- head 
- nodes
- null value 

## Parts of a single node:
- data
- reference to the next node 

## types of a linked lists:
- Singly linked lists
- doubly linked list
- circular linked list

## Traversal:
To traverse a linked list, your best way to do that through while() loop .

## Growing a linked list
1- find the head node of the linked list.

2-  make our new node, and set its pointer to the current first node of the list.

3- rearrange our head nodeâ€™s pointer to point at our new node.

## Print Out Nodes:
- go to Head Create a loop before the loop ends 
- set the Current to the next node.


## Big O
is the method to describe the efficient of time in the memory to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
