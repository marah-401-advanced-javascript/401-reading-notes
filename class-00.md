### How to Solve Programming Problems

1. Read the problem completely twice.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data:
    
3. Optimize the manual steps.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

6. Optimize the real code.


### Act like you make $1000/hr

- I think that its all about time management and how to work smart instead of just working hard ,
- Also being busy doesn't mean you are productive unless you are achieving things properly
- Every single one should open up the path for the apportunities , in my point of view ;this is how you will take the max benefit of your apportunities .

### How to think like a programmer

- In order to have a better approach to porblem solving you have to :
  - Have a framework/layout before you start coding :
    1. Understand the problem.
    2. Plan the solution.
    3. Divide the problem, break it into sub-problems.
    4. If you're stuck after that: 
       - Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
       - Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
       - Research but donâ€™t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. 
    5. Practice.
