## React 

- React is a User Interface (UI) library and a tool for building UI components.
- React elements are plain objects.
- React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.


## JSX

- syntax extension to JavaScript. 
- We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
- JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
- JSX produces React “elements”.

- “root” DOM node; everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
- To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to `ReactDOM.render()`
