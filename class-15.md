# TREES 

### Binary Search Tree Data Structure

- Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
- There must be no duplicate nodes.
- Insertion, deletion, searching of an element is faster in BINARY SEARCH TREE than BINARY TREE due to the ordered characteristics

### BINARY TREE	

-  A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
- is a non linear data structure where each node can have almost two child nodes.
- unordered hence slower in process of insertion, deletion and searching.	
- no ordering in terms of how the nodes are arranged
