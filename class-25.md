## Hook
-  A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features.
- For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. 

## When would I use a Hook?
- If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

## How does it work?
by convention, we use set + state-variable to name this function `useState()` takes a single param, which is the initial value to assign to the state variable

## Basic Hooks:
- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
