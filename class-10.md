# Stacks and Queues

### Stacks:

- Is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, that has two principal operations: 
- push: adds an element to the collection
- pop: which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

### WHY do we need stacks?

- A stack is needed to implement depth-first search (an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures).

### HOW to use stacks?

- array 
- linked list

### Queues?

- A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

### WHY do we need queues?

- Queues provide services in computer science, transport, and operations research where various entities such as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be processed later.
- queue performs the function of a buffer.
- also implementation of breadth-first search.

### HOW to use queues?

- they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure 
-  they are implemented in object-oriented languages as classes. 
- Common implementations are circular buffers and linked lists.
